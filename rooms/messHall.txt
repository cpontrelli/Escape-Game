MESS HALL
The two rows of benches are normally lined up in perfect order but now they stand in disarray. There's food splattered all over the floors and walls. It's a good thing you waited to mop until after your nap. Whatever happened here, people must have left in a hurry because they left their belongings scattered around.
The forward door opens to the sick bay and the port side door leads to the engine room. Behind you lies the safety of your supply closet.
