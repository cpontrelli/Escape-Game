SICK BAY
Like the mess hall, this typically tidy room looks like it has been ransacked. Some of the hospital beds have been flipped over and the cabinets have almost all been emptied. Luckily the floor and walls appear to be free of any bodlily fluids. You're in here all the time dealing with that.
The mess hall is back behind you and the transporter room is on the port side.
