SUPPLY CLOSET
Your home away from home. Some might call it cramped and messy but you call it cozy. It's much better to spend the night here than in a shared dorm. You've even fashioned a comfortable bed out of some old boxes and rags. The door locks from the inside and people rarely come in so you have the place  mostly to yourself.
The only door lies to the forward side of the ship and opens to the mess hall.
