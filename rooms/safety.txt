What's that?!?!
You bang your head against a low hanging shelf as you stumble out of bed. As you pick yourself up you realize it's just the sound of keys jangling outside your door.
Your boss walks in.
"You've been drinking in here again haven't you!? Get over to sick bay, it's a mess in there!"
He slams the door behind him.
Now by that point the memory of your nightmare had already faded so you decide to take one more swig and head back to work.
