ENGINE ROOM
A massive nuclear reactor stands in the center of the room with monitors on the sides flashing charts and numbers that you can't make any sense of. The walls to the right and left of you are covered in an intricate web of wires and pipes. On the back wall there's a row of shelves piled high with tools and various instruments.
Behind you lies the door to the mess hall and on the forward side of the room is a door to the transporter room.
