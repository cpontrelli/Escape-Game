TRANSPORTER ROOM
It's small room with nothing more than a couch and a coffee table beside the transportation platform. There's a control panel normally attended to by an annoying technician who always calls you champ and says "you missed a spot!" while you polish the platform.
The sick bay is behind you and there is a door to the engine room on the aft side of the room.
