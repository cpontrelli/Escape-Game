You bang your head on a low hanging shelf as you stumble out of bed. The gravity of the situation starts to sink in as you pick yourself up off the floor. That alarm has been going off for a while now. You know from evacuation drills that the countdown starts at 120 minutes and this is not a drill. Your friend in the safety department always warns you about those. He doesn't want you to get caught with your cart obstructing a doorway again.
Everyone else might be off the ship by now. You have to get to the transporter as soon as you can.
