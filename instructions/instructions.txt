INSTRUCTIONS
You will soon find yourself locked in the suppply closet of an empty spaceship. You don't know where everyone went or what happened to them, but you know you have to get off the spaceship before it self destructs. It is critical that you get to the transporter room and figure out how to transport off the ship.
In each room you will find a series of items to help you escape. Some items can be added to you inventory and others will have to be used in the room in which they were found. Inspect the items to find out more about them. You can carry up to 6 items at once. Be careful, the use of certain items will kill you. You only have a limited time to solve the puzzle.
Good Luck.
